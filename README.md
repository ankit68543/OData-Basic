# OData-Basic

#### Welcome All!

This repository is just the basic and very simple implementation of OData with dotnet core.

You guys are wondering what the hack is this..... ? :D

Let me put a very simple definition ,

##### "The Open Data Protocol (OData) is a data access protocol for the web. OData is a protocol that provides a flexibility of creating queryable REST services. It provides certain query options through which the on demand data can be fetched from the server by the client over HTTP"

The Open Data Protocol (OData) is a data access protocol for the web. OData provides a uniform way to query and manipulate data sets through CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete).
